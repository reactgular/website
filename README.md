# Reactgular

I am a [Front-End developer in Toronto, Ontario](https://reactgular.com) and this is the source code for my website.

## Overview

The website was created using [Angular](https://angular.io/) as the front-end framework, and [TypewriterJS](https://github.com/typewriterjs/typewriterjs) for the greeting animation that shows me typing in a terminal.

It was intended to be simple, give an example of out-of-the-box thinking and a jumping point to my online presence.  

## Installation

You can download and run the website on your local computer easily. The only prerequisite is that you install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) which can be done by following the instructions on their website.

The website can be installed and run by the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/reactgular/website.git
cd website
npm install
ng serve --open
```
